	Modified based on the answer from tig regarding question posted at
	http://superuser.com/questions/174576/opening-a-new-terminal-from-the-command-line-and-running-a-command-on-mac-os-x
	I Expanded its feature a bit by allowing -w option top run command in a new window.

## Usage Example:
	./dt ls -l
	./dt -w top

## Notes
	Tested with Ruby 1.8.7 on Mac OS X 10.7.2
